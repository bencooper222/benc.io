# License

I doubt this will ever be relevant but note that I reserve all rights over all code and content on this website _and past versions of both_. I am willing to give away some of the code - I removed the MIT License because I didn't want to license off some of it and particular licensing to parts of the website seemed like a waste of time. Contact me for details on licensing.
